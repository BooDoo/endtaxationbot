A simple Twitter bot that replies to any mentions of the word
"taxation" with one of two messages:

* Taxation is theft. End it.
* Taxation is extortion. End it.

It searches for "taxation" once per hour, requesting ten replies since
the last reply it received. It replies to each search result, unless
that result is from or mentions a user in a tweet already replied to
from this search.
